            eusVille beta launched with eusVote.

            Ever see a movie with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 88? Looks good. So you watch and you're like "how is this crap rated 88?"  
            Now, instead of relying on Rotten Tomtoes for ratings, why not get connected to people's opinions whose thinking reflects your's?  
            
            <p>eusVote is it.</p>

            Next time, RT may have a movie rated 88. But your good buddy watches it and says it's a 60. You trust his judgement. But collectively, you have 10 other friends who rate it an average 55. 
            So should you watch it based on RT's 88 rating or would you prefer the 55 rating provided by your close constituents?

            <p>this is eusVote - to collect the wisdom of everyone under the sun. Join us to make the world a better place.</p>

            One keystroke at a time.
